    Some conventions guiding this manifest file and its child files:

      1. Projects are organized in two main repo groups (c.f. the XML attribute
         "groups" of "<project>" XML tags):
           * The "image" group which encloses all the projects specific to a
             dedicated CLIP OS image (e.g. the reference toolkit, the CLIP OS
             recipes, the Portage trees and overlays and so on...).
           * The "alt" group which encloses all the third-party projects or
             in-house projects required to build a CLIP OS image but whose git
             repository state is not defined by their current HEAD in the
             source tree but by a git reference in another project (e.g.
             CROS_WORKON value for the case of a project whose usage is wrapped
             inside an ebuild package in a Portage tree overlay). This other
             project owning the git reference for this "alt"-categorized
             project must be a project belonging to the "image" repo group.
      2. XML attributes are listed in lexicographic order and XML tags must fit
         on one line (the 80 columns limitation does not matter here). This
         convention is to ensure that the "cosmk snapshot" feature won't break
         most of the formatting of these XML files (XML comments are
         preserved).
